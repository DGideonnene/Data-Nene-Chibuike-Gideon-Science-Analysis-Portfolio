## [Project 2:  Comprehensive Business Metrics Analysis and Growth Strategies](https://github.com/DGideonnene/Business-Metrics-Analysis-and-Growth-Strategies)
*This report analyzes key business metrics, uncovering trends in order growth, product performance, and customer behavior. Highlights include strong revenue growth, high-value customer contributions, and insights into return rates. Actionable strategies focus on enhancing product quality, optimizing inventory, and targeting marketing efforts for sustained growth.*

### Tools Used:
- Data Processing & Analysis: Excel/Power Query
- Visualization: Power Bi

### Actionable Insights/Recommendations
- Improve Product Quality: The high return rates for Tires and Tubes and Bottles and Cages indicate a need to assess product quality and customer feedback.
- Leverage High-Value Customers: Engage top customers like Mr. Maurice Shan with personalized offers to encourage repeat purchases.
- Optimize Inventory for Growth: Given the strong demand for Accessories and Bikes, stock allocation should be adjusted to ensure high availability.
- Marketing Strategy Adjustments: Focus on increasing customer acquisition within professional and skilled manual segments by tailoring marketing campaigns to their preferences.
- Address Seasonal Demand: Revenue spikes suggest a seasonal component-implement targeted promotions during peak periods to maximize revenue.

## [Project 4:  Predicting Calories Burnt During a Workout Session](https://github.com/DGideonnene/Prediction-of-Calories-during-a-workout-session)
*The goal of this project is to analyze the provided dataset, perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, and build a linear regression model to predict the number of calories burnt during a workout session.*

#### Performance Metrics
1. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Train MSE: 0.145
  - Test MSE: 0.143

The lower MSE indicated better predictive accuracy. The close proximity of training and testing MSE values suggests that the model does not exhibit significant overfitting.
2. R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
  - Train R²: 0.9884
  - Test R²: 0.9889

With an R² value of approximately 0.988, the model explains 98.8% of the variance in the target variable, indicating a strong predictive performance. The minimal difference between the training and testing R² scores suggests that the model generalizes well.

#### Model Evaluation
- The low MSE values indicated that the model's predictions are relatively accurate. However, the absolute value of MSE should be considered in the context of the dataset’s scale.
- The high R² score implied that the model explains most of the variance, signifying strong predictive power.
- The small gap between training and testing metrics suggested minimal overfitting, indicating that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

#### Recommendations for Improvement
Although the model performs well, further refinements can be considered to enhance performance:
#####Hyperparameter Tuning
- Optimize hyperparameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Randomized Search.
- If using a linear regression model, explore polynomial features or regularization techniques (Lasso, Ridge).
- For tree-based models, adjust the depth, learning rate, or number of estimators.

#### Conclusion
The model exhibited strong performance with an R² score of 0.988 and a relatively low MSE, indicating high predictive accuracy. Given the minimal difference between training and testing performance, the model effectively generalizes to unseen data. While the model is already well-optimized, applying hyperparameter could further enhance its accuracy.
